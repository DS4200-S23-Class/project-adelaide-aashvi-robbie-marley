00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.960
there we decided to visualize opioid death data;
in New York state from 2003 to 2019 our data;

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.460
source is owned and published by the New York State;
Department of Health and it consisted of Year New;

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.840
York state county and a number of opioid deaths;
that occurred that occurred in that county per;

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:26.460
year so to begin we first must use the drop down;
to select a specific County in New York state so;

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.620
for this demonstration I'll choose Albany and from;
there we get two visualizations that get generated;

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.920
first the first visualization is a bar chart that;
shows the number of deaths that occurred in the;

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.260
specific chosen County each year hovering;
over the bar chart will reveal a tool tip;

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.120
that again shows a year and the total death;
count in that county for that specific year&;

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:57.000
next we have a map of New York State the map;
consists of a heat map where the darker shade of;

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
blue represents a greater total number of deaths;
that occurred in the county from the specified;

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.180
timeline which is 2003 to 2019 highlighting;
over accounting will reveal the name of the;

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.120
county the total number of deaths that occurred;
and the county visualized visualized in pink;

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.400
is the county chosen from the drop down that we;
specified in the beginning of the demonstration
